This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi).

## Getting Started

This example uses Coinbase Smart Wallet [smart-wallet](https://www.smartwallet.dev/why) and Wagmi [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started) to create a [ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/) smart contract account and send a sponsored transaction.

We'll be minting a NFT on Base Sepolia using Coinbase Developer Platform's Paymaster & Bundler.

Ensure you have the `VITE_RPC_URL` variables set in the `env.local`.
